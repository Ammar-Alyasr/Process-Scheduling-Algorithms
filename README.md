###First-Come First-Serve(FCFS)
1)Policy: Process that requests the CPU FIRST 
is allocated the CPU FIRST.<br>
2)FCFS is a non-preemptive algorithm. <br>
3)Implementation - using FIFO queues. Incoming process is added to the tail of the queue. Process selected for execution is taken from head of queue. <br>
4)Performance metric - Average waiting time in queue. <br>
